## 5 Reasons Why You Should Learn Python Programming

If you are new to Python programming or in computer programming in general, it would certainly be important for you to get some information on the advantages and disadvantages of the language and understand why would somebody want to use it. In this post, i will not enter into the technical details of the language nor use fancy words to describe you some of the language specifics. My intention is to give you some simple insight so that you can decide for yourself whether or not it would be a good idea for you to choose Python as your main programming language or just use it for certain projects.

Why Use Python ?

There are some very good reasons for which you would want to use python that i will be enlisting for you below : (please bear in mind that there might be more reasons why one should use python, but this is what i feel about the language based on my own experience with it)

1. Python is Easy to Learn

This is one of the most important things about Python and is in fact one of the main reasons why this is a very solid first programming language choice. Python’s overall structure is very clear and pretty easy for newcomers to programming to master. Since it is a high level language, this means that simple operations like string copies and such are done in very clear and easy syntax and using few commands (just one in most cases).

2. Python is Fast to Program

As you become more competent in Python programming, you will notice that you can code some pretty complicated scripts that do lots of work for you in a matter of hours or even minutes. Python’s nature lies within the scripting languages that are created to target the fast and easy programming variants. Therefore, if you wish to create various scripts to simplify casual everyday work, Python is surely the language of choice.

3. Python Has a Clear Syntax

You may feel that this is not that important but for scripting languages it really is a great asset. For instance, if you happen to be a perl programmer (or hacker), you may have already faced dozens of perl lines of code that look like hieroglyphic even to their very programmers. Python is pretty easy to descramble and you are most likely to remember what your source code does even after a long time passes.

4. Python Has Solid Documentation and a Large Set of Modules

Most of the times you will be finding very nice references and documentation on the modules that you need to use (not all times though, i must warn). The great thing is that Python has a very large set of modules virtually allowing you to do just about anything you can imagine with the language. However, you would probably need to elaborate a bit in order to discover the ins and outs of some modules (like twisted for instance).

5. Python is Cross Platform, Also Featuring Nice GUIs

A great thing about Python that you will most probably love if you tend to use lots of operating systems is its cross platform compatibility. Python can run on virtually any machine you can thing of and therefore your creations will run everywhere 99% of times. Moreover, Python cooperates very nicely with cross platform GUIs like GTK or Qt. As a result of that, you can create GUIs that run on most platforms without having to readjust the source code for each one.

There are probably the 5 most important things that I can think of that you should be aware of before selecting to use Python. If you are still doubtful about whether it is a good choice to select Python or not, please take my word for it, it’s one of the best choices you could make


## 学习python的五个理由

如果你刚刚开始python编程or实际上进行计算机编程,也许对你来说比较重要的是了解一门语言的优势并且理解别人为什么使用它.在这篇文章里,它不会进入技术的细节,不使用指定的语言词汇,我的目的是给你一些简单的观点,因而你能决定是否选择python语言作为你的主要语言,or,只在实际项目做到.

### 为什么使用python?
这里有非常好的原因,为什么使用python


1. python语言容易学习

结构明了,容易维护,因为作为高级语言,这意味着简单的操作比如字符串复制和其他就会非常清楚和语法简单

2. python语言是快速编程的语言
比如你日夜不停的使用python编程,你会发现通过几个小时,甚至几分钟写的简单脚本能做很多事.
python语言有着落脚本语言的优势,能够快速目标编程并且容易变形.不仅如些,如果你想编写脚本处理日常事务,python 语言是一个明智的选择.

3. python 语言有清楚的语法.

4. python 有完整的文档和超多的模块.
许多时候你会不得不花好多时间在查看引用和参考.好消息是python有超多模块,因此你想就有.


5. python 跨平台.
